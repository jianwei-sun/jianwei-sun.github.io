details:
    - Developed an open-source safety-focused admittance control library (including multi-arm collision avoidance) for physical human-robot interaction with real-time collision avoidance (QP solved online) (C/C++) <a href="https://github.com/jianwei-sun/gtfo/" target="_blank"><b>(GitHub)</b></a>
    - "Investigated holonomically constrained admittance control using feedback linearization for robot-assisted rehabilitation (C/C++)"
    - "Implemented a feedback linearization-based joint-space controller with symbolic dynamics for a Harmonic drive and brushless DC-actuated exoskeleton (C/C++)" 
    - "Developed virtual dynamics to improve the admittance control scheme of a bimanual 8 degree-of-freedom upper-limb exoskeleton (C/C++)"
    - "Developed a Kalman filter-based sensor fusion method to achieve similar human-exoskeleton transparency using only a subset of six-axis force/torque sensors (C/C++)"
    - "Implemented a rate-limiting filter to suppress unstable human-induced oscillations due to physiological and mechanical time delays (C/C++)"
